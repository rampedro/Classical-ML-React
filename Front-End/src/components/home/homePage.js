                This is a React application that uses D3.js to visualize several 
                classical machine learning algorithms. 
                All visualizations are computed through a Flask backend server. 
                Each page has a "Background" section (on the bottom) if you wish to learn 
                more about the algorithm itself.
            </p>
        </div>

# Python back end with javascript(react) front end

In this application we are using D3.js to visualiuze data while also benefiting from some machine learning algorithms.

All visualizations are computed through a Flask backend server. 
  
To run locally:
  - Download the repo.
  - Run the back-end server.
  - Run the front-end app.
  
Instructions for running both the front-end and back-end are in README files within each respective directory.
